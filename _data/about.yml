I live for being the supportive inventory backbone that a company needs. I understand what it takes to assemble projects with a critical eye for every detail, the vitality of communicating well, and what it means to wear multiple hats.

I’m driven and self taught, but I never hesitate to learn what I can from others.

I want to work for a company where I can proud of what I’ve helped create, and work with a team of people as dedicated to quality as I am.
