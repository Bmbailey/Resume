- Generally, I love putting things together. I enjoy video and film work for that reason. What starts as an idea, grows and transforms into a full and complete project. Every good project requires a little heart and soul to go along with the sweat and tears.

- Applying that same passion into every project or repair, is what makes me tick. Whether is fixing a device, a machine, someone's day, or finishing an edit. My family's blue collar work ethic is embedded into me, thankfully through software and hardware instead crops and chickens.
