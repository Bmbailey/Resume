- I enjoy video and film work for that reason. What starts as an idea, grows and transforms into a full and complete project. Every good project requires a little heart and soul to go along with the sweat and tears.

- Applying that same passion into every project or repair is what makes me tick. Whether it's fixing a device, repairing a machine, saving someone's day, or finishing an edit, my family's blue-collar work ethic is embedded into me, thankfully through software and hardware instead of crops and chickens.

I'm most passionate about my work when I'm fixing something, or creating a project from scratch. I love providing technical understanding, resolving problems and developing video projects from beginning to end.
