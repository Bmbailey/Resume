- For 13 years, I've been working side by side with customers. From supporting 400 customers daily, to beta software troubleshooting, I've always enjoyed providing a helping hand through customer support.

- I'm self taught, and solution driven. I thrive in an environment where keeping up with all of the moving parts at once is vital, and I live for connecting the pieces.
