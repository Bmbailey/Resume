- I live for connecting the dots and building projects from the ground up. I understand what it takes to assemble projects with a critical eye for every detail, the vitality of communicating well, and what it means to wear multiple hats.

- I'm self taught, and story driven. Iâ€™m passionate about constantly learning, and developing both technically and creatively.
